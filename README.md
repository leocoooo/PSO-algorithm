# PSO-algorithm
Work on the bio-inspired metaheuristic optimisation algorithm called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

Our results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of this algorithm in solving a wide range of problems (including extremely complex functions), outperforming more traditional methods such as gradient descent or the Newton-Raphson method.
Use of Monte-Carlo simulations.

This paper was produced using SAS language and software. I have only included the final code, which runs a "basic" PSO algorithm. For any other code used in this paper, please ask me. 

I have also quickly coded this algorithm in python, you will find the necessary scripts in the python.zip file.
